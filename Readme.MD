## Purpose

This program is used to handle students submitting computer code for marking.

The school board does not have any simple and effective way for students to upload code. Neither Brightspace nor Google Classroom works well.

I wrote this to do everything that I want and need. Students log in, quickly upload single or multiple files, I can download them easily 
(and none of the formatting gets changed in the process).  In the app, I add comments and give them a mark.

Students can log on and see the comments about their code as well as the mark that they received. Timestamps track when the code was uploaded and when it was marked. 

I can select students by course section or look at all the code by one student.

:dart: Note: I do not have a fake database so I cannot open the app up for people to test out. I only have actual student data there.

## Improvements

If this amazing app ever gets used by others, I will add in two things:
1️⃣  a password reset feature (the admin can reset the password, and the user can then log in and then change the password to whatever he/she wants)
2️⃣ a way to divide students into three classes, A,B,C.  Right now there is just A and B, and O being all. However, this data has to be entered using PHPmyAdmin
